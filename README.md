### How to Download

1. Download JDK 8+ (java dev kit)

**IMPORTANT** 

- _The program uses certain sequences to put color in the terminal, so it may not work in Windows._
- _The java file may not find the external packages. Download the jar file, if possible._


**To run the `.java` file:**

1. Use IntelliJ IDEA, place json jars in external libraries. :P (for now, I am not using Maven/Gradle)
